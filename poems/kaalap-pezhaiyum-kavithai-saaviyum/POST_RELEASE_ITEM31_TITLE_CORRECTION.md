# Post-release source correction — Item 31 title

Date: **2026-09-08**

Work: `காலப் பேழையும் கவிதைச் சாவியும்`  
Stable item: **31**  
Title scan: **148**  
Physical range: **148–151**

## Trigger

The user flagged that the contents and poem-opening page do not carry the same lexical title. The controlling Tamil PDF was attached again and scan 148 was reread directly.

## Source witnesses

### Contents witness

The contents entry remains:

`மாண்பு நிறை தாயும், மாசற்ற மகனும்!`

This is retained exactly as a contents/index witness.

### Direct item-opening witness — controlling for canonical title

Physical scan 148 visibly reads:

`மாண்பு நிறை தாயும்`
`மாசற்ற மகளும்!`

Therefore the canonical title is:

**`மாண்பு நிறை தாயும் மாசற்ற மகளும்!`**

## Why the previous record was wrong

The earlier Phase-2/title-reconciliation record accidentally carried the contents lexical form `மகனும்` into the scan-148 page/title layer while correctly noticing only the contents comma difference. This was a witness-conflation error, not an ambiguity in the scan.

The repository's governing rule already states that the direct item-opening title-page witness controls canonical assembly. Applying that existing rule requires `மகளும்`.

## Body corroboration — not the authority for correction

The poem itself is about **Madhavi and Manimekalai**. The verified closing lines say:

`மாதவி, மேகலை யெனும்`
`மாண்பு நிறை தாய் மகள் வரலாறு`

This is consistent with the corrected title, but the correction is based on the directly visible scan-148 title, not on semantic harmonization from the body.

## Durable corrections

- `pages/0148.md`: title-page transcription `மகனும்` → **`மகளும்`**;
- `sections/31.md`: canonical Tamil title and opening title line corrected to **`மகளும்`**;
- `PHASE3_TITLE_WITNESS_RECONCILIATION.md`: item-31 contents/title-page witnesses separated correctly;
- English item title: **The Mother Full of Dignity and the Stainless Daughter!**;
- Bharathiar University witness `An Honourable Mother and an Upright Daughter` reclassified from supposed editorial emendation to **corroborating secondary evidence**;
- contents witness remains unchanged and is not normalized.

## Textual scope

This is a **title-only source-backed correction**. No narrative/body wording on scans 149–151 is changed. Stable item number, scan range, page joins and item boundaries are unchanged.

## Decision

**SOURCE-BACKED REOPEN: PASS / CORRECTION APPLIED.**

The Tamil item is re-cleared with canonical title **`மாண்பு நிறை தாயும் மாசற்ற மகளும்!`**. The older `மகனும்` title-page/canonical claim is superseded; `மகனும்` survives only as the separate contents witness.

## Synchronization closure

The downstream release surfaces have now been synchronized and verified.

- aggregate size: **321,112 bytes**;
- aggregate line count: **16,308**;
- `Daughter` item-31 heading/opening occurrences: **1 / 1**;
- obsolete `Son` item-31 heading/opening occurrences: **0 / 0**;
- reviewed Batch 12: synchronized;
- standalone English item 31 and `items/README.md`: synchronized;
- work-level English release: **RE-CLEARED — PASS**;
- unresolved synchronization holds: **0**.

The source-backed reopen is therefore **CLOSED**. Routine work may return to the Bharathiar University secondary-witness queue.
